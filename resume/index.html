			<h1>Professional summary</h1>
			<p>
				Passionate about software engineering since high school, I have spent countless hours working on side and personal projects just for the sake of coding. Since then, my professional experiences have made me a team player which is very different from working on personal projects. I'm a code idealist even though compromises must be made in a fast-moving environment with various levels of expertise and experience. Finding good tradeoffs is a whole part of the challenge. Nevertheless, I'm very committed to code quality and I'm looking for a company which deeply cares about the quality of their technical products.
			</p>
			<p>
				As most recruiters would expect it, I included a "Skills" section in this resume but it is for information purposes only about the main tools I have used in the past. The list is not exhaustive nor static. I want to make it crystal clear that I'm more than willing to learn new technologies and languages. In my opinion, software engineering is a language-agnostic philosophy and my skills extend beyond the scope of the few technologies I have been using on a daily basis.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a highly technical and full-stack profile. I don't have any preferences regarding front-end or back-end and I strive to keep practicing both. I enjoy learning and working with new tools so I will be happy to contribute to other projects as well. I have for example made significant contributions to the infrastructure along with the ops team at AKUR8.
			</p>
			<p>
				In that context, I have grown significant debugging skills which made me a key asset in the engineering teams I had the opportunity to be part of. Client support and issue resolution in production are not emphasized enough in hiring processes. Yet they are key to any software company. Designing proper software is essential, having it effectively running in practice is vital.

			<h1>Work history</h1>

				<h2>
					<span class="occupation-title">Senior Software Engineer</span>
					<span class="time">2020 - Present</span>
				</h2>
				<h3 class="location">AKUR8 - Paris, France</h3>
				<p>
					I joined AKUR8 the day after my apprenticeship contract ended. Unlike Fret SNCF, AKUR8 is a software company. It sells a SaaS platform to insurance companies to allow them to build commercial premiums. The product is very technical is all aspects. It involves a lot of data science to create machine learning models using proprietary algorithms owned by the company. The technical stack is Angular for the front-end and Java Spring Boot for the back-end. The database management system is also PostgreSQL. The software is hosted on AWS so I increased my cloud-related knowledge quite dramatically.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to developing new features along with other developers and data scientists, I took part in the technical assessment of candidates during the recruitment process, including senior profiles. I was also a member of both front-end and back-end committees to define guidelines for all developers within the company.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was involved in the design and architecture of key components of the platform. The technical expertise that I built during those years was widely acknowledged across the company including beyond tech teams.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was also largely associated with my involvement in client support. I can safely say that I learned how to debug a complex architecture thanks to AKUR8.

					<span class="occupation-title">Software Engineer</span>
					<span class="time">2017 - 2020</span>
				</h2>
				<h3 class="location">Fret SNCF - Clichy-la-Garenne, France</h3>
				<p>
					I spent a three-year apprenticeship at Fret SNCF. This is where I learned how to do software professionally. I was working on a Java Swing client application with a relational PostgreSQL database whose development was outsourced. I have been technically mentored by the development team from the service company.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of my second year, the contract with the service company ended and another company won the call for bids. In just three months, a dozen of developers who worked on the project for several years had to leave. This was extremely brutal for the project. I went from the least experienced developer on the project to the most experienced almost from one day to the next. This was very challenging but also very educative and rewarding. During the next two years, I developed major features for the application and helped the new team of developers to become more comfortable with the quite large codebase.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also had the opportunity to technically mentor a Software Engineer intern in my team during my last year in apprenticeship.
